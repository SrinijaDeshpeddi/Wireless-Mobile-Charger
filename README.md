This project showcases a Wireless Mobile Charger designed using inductive power transfer. By generating a magnetic field from the transmitter coil and capturing it through the receiver coil, the system delivers a regulated 5V DC output for mobile charging without any physical connection. It provides a simple, safe, and efficient method of wireless charging within a small range.
How It Works

DC input is converted to AC using a MOSFET.

AC powers the transmitter coil, creating a magnetic field.

Receiver coil picks up the field and induces AC voltage.

AC is rectified and filtered.

Voltage regulator provides a stable 5V DC output for charging.
